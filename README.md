# 1x.engineer

This repo is the source of 1x.engineer, a website illustrating what a 1x engineer _really_ is.

## Contributing

Want to help contribute to 1x.engineer? Cool! Feel free to PR whatever you think is appropriate and fitting with the theme, as long as your contributions are in-line with the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). I'll try to be on top of PRs, and will add those who get involved with the project beyond single PRs as collaborators.

### New Traits

Feel free to add new traits of 1x developers. We generally try to keep traits free of blame, and be sure not to exclude 1x developers in the phrasing or intent of the traits.

### Editing Traits

If there are refinements that can be made to existing traits to make them more accurate or inclusive of 1x developers, please feel free to make them â€“ your contributions are more than welcome.

Additionally, if you feel that a trait doesn't represent 1x developers, please feel free to remove it and share why. This project goes both ways.

### Trolls

Since this is a very human-focused project, it will attract troll Pull Requests, Issues, and comments. Please don't. If you do, we'll just block you from the repository.
